    <p>The best way to really impress people and show off like a boss is popping a wheelie on your dirt bike.

Okay, NOT! But you're going to do it anyway so we might as well give you some instruction on the proper way to do a wheelie so you don't hurt yourself and look like a goon.
</p>
<p>Grip your bike firmly with your legs and scoot back on the bike.  You CAN scoot too far back, which will make you fall on your back.  A good rule of thumb is to make the back of your butt hit 2 inches from the back of your seat.

    <p>Keep one finger on the clutch and your foot over the rear brake. If you ever feel like you’re going to flip your bike, give the rear brake a light tap to bring her back down.

    <p> Place your bike on second gear. Rev up the engine with the throttle and the clutch pulled in so you’re still staying still.  Then release the clutch all at once while maintaining throttle.  This will pop the wheel up.  If needed, pull back lightly on the handlebars at the same time.</p>

    <p>4. It’s all about body position, balance and the right amount of throttle.  You’ll adjust those as you ride the wheelie to stay up.</p>

    <p>5. Practice. Practice. Practice! The only way I got good at this was by finding a nice long stretch of land (the beach in my case) and practicing. I started off by just lifting the front wheel for a second. Then learned how to hold it up for longer. After a fair bit of practice, you’ll find you can change through the gears as you go and hold the wheelie for as long as you like. There’s a sweet spot – or balancing point where the bike feels weightless. This is where you want to be.  It’s a great feeling.</p>
